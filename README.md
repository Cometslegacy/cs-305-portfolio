    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
        Artemis financial required refactoring their code to implement new security measures, including HTTPS, and a checksum verification
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
        When I discovered their software security vulnerabiltiies, I was able to implement the fix for the checksum easily. Implmenting the checksum is important because it can be used as a digital signature online. Adding software security can help a company stay safe and ensure that data does not become comprimized 
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
        When going through the vulnerability assessment diagaram was challenging for me because I kept finding that some areas would overlap, like "Quality Code" seems like a subset of most of the other areas.
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
        To increase lays of security, we can use the vulnerability assessment diagram to ensure that all the areas are covered and secured.
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
        One way to check if the code is vulnerability safe is to use things like OWASP dependancy checker to see if you've introduced any new issues while refactoring.
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
        I have never heard of OWASP dependancy checker before this, and it seems extremely helpful to be aware of any vulnerabilities you might encounter.
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
        I can show them how to create a certificate and enable HTTPS on their websites.
